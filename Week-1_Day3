Q1.During the code-based test of Java, Peter has been assigned a task to implement a class which reads the Account Number(Long), Account Holder Name(String), Gender (M/F) (Character) and Amount (Integer) to be withdrawn at runtime.

Given that the Current Account Balance is 20000, it is expected to perform the withdrawl if amount to be withdrawn is less than or equal to 20000 and message to be displayed is:

Hi Mr./Ms. XXX! Your Account Balance after withdrawl is YYYYY.

If the amount to be withdrawn is greater than the Current Account Balance, then the message displayed is:

Hi Mr./Ms. XXX! Insufficient Funds! You can not withdraw AAAAA.

Input Format

First line reads Account Number

Second line reads Account Holder Name

Third line reads Gender

Fourth line reads Amount to be withdrawn

Constraints

Account Number is a 10 digit number

Output Format

**Hi Mr./Ms. XXX!

Your Account Balance after withdrawl is YYYYY.**

        long AccNo = in.nextLong();
        in.nextLine();
        String name = in.nextLine();
        char gender = in.next().charAt(0);
        in.nextLine();
        int Amount = in.nextInt();
        if(gender=='M')
            System.out.println("Hi Mr. "+name+"!");
        else if(gender=='F')
            System.out.println("Hi Ms. "+name+"!");
        
        if(20000<Amount)
            System.out.println("Insufficient Funds! You can not withdraw "+Amount+".");
        else
            System.out.println("Your Account Balance after withdrawl is "+(20000-Amount)+".");
       
    }
}
